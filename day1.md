# Bootcamp Day 1! 👢🏕

**Agenda:**

- Spin up your own computer!
- Linux, VMs
- Become a command-line wizard

## Let's begin!

### Spin up your own computer!

Each of you is gonna get his own virtual machine, courtesy of Google!

1. Visit https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?project=data-8.
2. Click the menu icon in top left -> Compute Engine
3. Click "Create Instance"
    - Name the instance `yourname-test` where `yourname` is your name.
    - Zone: us-central1-a
    - Machine type: small
    - Image: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
    - Allow both HTTP and HTTPS traffic
    - SSH Keys -> Paste your public ssh key into the textfield. If you don't
      know what that means, just let me know and I'll take care of it for you.
      We'll go over what those are later on today.
4. Create!

### Linux, VMs

### Become a command-line wizard

Alrighty! It's time to move beyond the basics and become command-line wizards.
Follow [this tutorial][tut2] up to the System and Program Information section.
There's a lot. Don't worry about absorbing everything. The point of this is
just to know what tools exist.

Let's keep pressing on! Finish going through that doc.
